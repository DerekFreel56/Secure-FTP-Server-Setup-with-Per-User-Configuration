This project sets up a secure and efficient FTP server using vsftpd. 
It ensures that each user has a dedicated FTP directory separate from their home directory, enhancing security and organization. 
The setup enforces strict access controls, allowing users to read, write, and execute files only within their assigned directories while preventing access to others' data.
Additionally, the configuration includes per-user FTP settings to customize access and restrictions. 
To enhance security, file upload restrictions are implemented, preventing multimedia files from being uploaded. 
The setup is optimized for user management, security, and controlled file transfers.
This FTP solution is ideal for environments requiring isolated user access with customizable permissions. 
It provides a robust, scalable, and secure way to manage FTP users while ensuring compliance with best security practices.
